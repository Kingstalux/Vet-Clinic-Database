# Vet Clinic

> In this project I used a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I created a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it. Next, I used transactions to update and delete records. I also used my knowledge of aggregate functions and GROUP BY to answer analytical questions. In the next milestone of this project I added some new tables and added foreign key columns to my existing animals table to model one-to-many relationships. Afterward, I used JOIN to query the data. Finanly, I added some many-to-many relationships and wrote more complex queries to use them to answer questions. In the next milestone, we got a database diagram, interpreted it, and implemented the SQL needed to build the database.
